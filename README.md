# 🌍 Mobility Strategist | Remote Ops & Infrastructure | Cross-Border Navigator

Hi, I’m Iris — a remote infrastructure tactician helping individuals and small teams **strategize international relocation, digital operations, and lifestyle design** with clarity and discretion.

With experience spanning high-volume logistics, asynchronous team leadership, and cross-border frameworks, I work at the intersection of **mobility, compliance, and strategic autonomy**.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 📦 Remote Operations & Process Mapping  
  Build workflows that scale — especially when your team (or life) moves.

- 🌐 Strategic Relocation Support  
  I guide clients through the decision layers of living abroad, setting up global-friendly structures, and managing risk before it shows up.

- 📊 Infrastructure for Digital Living  
  Systems, documents, roles, flows — I create the *back-end of freedom* so people can move forward without chaos.

## 🔍 My Background (Selected Work)

- **Aurelia Collective** – Remote Ops & Structure Design (2024–)  
  Created contractor classification systems and global-first frameworks for purpose-driven orgs.

- **Amazon DSP** – Dispatcher & Ops Manager (2022–2024)  
  Managed delivery ops and mentored diverse teams in high-pressure environments.

- **Virtual Insurance** – Remote Biz Owner (2019–2024)  
  Ran a fully digital business focused on compliant frameworks across state lines.

- **Private Security Firm** – Shift Supervisor (2024–2025)  
  Directed live incident responses, team coordination, and escalated reporting.

Each role sharpened my core strengths in **precision, process, and adaptability** — the same traits required for intentional global living.

## 🛠️ Areas of Focus

- Strategic relocation decision-making  
- Global-first process audits & system design
